  <h3>Current Projects <em>"Under Construction"</em></h3>
  <p>Here are three project links to Webpages I'd like to improve on.
    <ol>
      <li>Here was my first <strong>HTML</strong> website of some of favorite places. <a href="https://github.com/dulcelj55/my-first-website2.git">My First Webpage</a></li>
      <li>This project <a href="https://github.com/dulcelj55/madlibs.git">Madlibs</a> was a fun project I did with some classmates. It was my first time using <strong>CSS</strong> </a></li>
      <li> I would like to improve most of my pages as my <strong>CSS</strong> abilities grow. This one needs much attention. It's a <strong>HTML</strong> doc of <a href="https://github.com/dulcelj55/Chula.git"> Chula</a> , my dog.</li>
